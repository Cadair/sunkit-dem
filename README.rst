Sunkit-Dem is an open-source package for computing solar differential emission measure distributions.

Installation
============

If you want to help develop sunkit-image, or just want to try out the package, you will need to install it from GitHub.
The best way to do this is to create a new python virtual environment (either with ``pipenv`` or ``conda``).
Once you have that virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-image.git
    $ cd sunkit-dem
    $ pip install -e .

For detailed (general) installation instructions, see the `installation guide`_ in the SunPy docs.
